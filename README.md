## General info
This Python project is designed to help users stay organised and motivated while managing their daily tasks. Most to-do lists are purely functional by allowing users to tick off their tasks, without providing any motivation for the user. This prototype solves this problem by displaying a confetti GIF and motivational quote to provide motivation to the user to finish all their tasks.
